Car Price Analysis and Visualization:
This repository contains code for analyzing and visualizing car prices using machine learning techniques. The project encompasses various tasks such as data cleansing, regression analysis, classification analysis, clustering, and visualization.

Overview
The main script, car_price_analysis.py, performs the following tasks:
  Data cleansing: Removes rows with missing values and converts categorical variables to numeric using Label Encoding.
  Regression analysis: Uses Linear Regression to predict car prices based on various features.
  Classification analysis: Utilizes Logistic Regression to classify cars based on their exchangeability.
  Clustering: Applies K-means clustering to cluster cars based on odometer value, year produced, and price.
  Visualization: Generates visualizations including scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to explore the data.

Dependencies:
  Pandas
  NumPy
